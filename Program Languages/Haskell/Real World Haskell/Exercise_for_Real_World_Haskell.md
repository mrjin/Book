# Exercise for Real World Haskell

##ã€€Chapter 1 Getting Started
1. Types
+ 5 + 8, 3 * 5 + 8, 2 + 4, (+) 2 4, succ 6, succ 7
    Num
+ sqrt 16, sin(pi/2)
    Floating
+ truncate pi, round 3.5, round 3.4, floor 3.7, ceiling 3.3
    Integral

2. :show bingings
```
it :: Integral b => b = _
x :: Num a => a = _
```

3.
```Haskell
main = interact wordCount
    where wordCount input = show (length (words input)) ++ "\n"
```

4.
```Haskell
main = interact charCount
    where charCount input = show (length input) ++ "\n"
```

## Using Composite Data Types
False :: Bool
(["foo", "bar"], 'a') :: ([[Char]], Char)
[(True, []), (False, [['a']])] :: [(Bool, [[Char]])]

## The Type of a Function of More Than One Argument
1. it can return an element which is the same type of any element in the list,
it can not change that. The function can only word with list rather than other
structures.
2. function `lastButOne`
```
lastButOne :: [a] -> a
lastButOne [] = error "Can't call lastButOne on a empty list"
lastButOne (x:[]) = error "Can't call lastButOne on a list with one element"
lastButOne (x:xs) = if length xs == 1 then x else lastButOne xs
```
3. it will raise an exception.
